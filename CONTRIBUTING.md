# Lido Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Lido Contribution Guide! Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lido! Join our community of contributors who are passionate about advancing liquid staking. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving the documentation, your contribution is valuable and your effort to make Lido better is appreciated.

## Ways to Contribute

### Opening an Issue

Issues are a great way to contribute to the project by reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements.

- **Bug Reports**. If you encounter a bug, please report it using the GitHub issues feature. Check first to ensure the bug hasn't already been reported. If it has, you can contribute further by adding more detail to the existing report. _Note that this only relates to off-chain code (tests, scripts, etc.), for bugs in contracts and protocol vulnerabilities, please refer to [Bug Bounty](/README.md#bug-bounty)_.

- **Feature Requests**: Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Submit a feature request through the GitHub issues, detailing your proposed enhancements and how they would benefit the Lido Finance Core.

### Improving Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for any project. If you have suggestions for improving the documentation, or if you've noticed an omission or error, making these corrections is a significant contribution. Whether it's a typo, additional examples, or clearer explanations, your help in making the documentation more accessible and understandable is highly appreciated.

For expansive documentation, visit the [Lido Docs repo](https://github.com/lidofinance/docs).

### Contributing to codebase

Contributing by resolving open issues is a valuable way to help improve the project. Look through the existing issues for something that interests you or matches your expertise. Don't hesitate to ask for more information or clarification if needed before starting. If you're interested in improving tooling and CI in this repository, consider opening a feature request issue first to discuss it with the community of contributors.

If you have a bigger idea on how to improve the protocol, consider publishing your proposal to [Lido Forum](https://research.lido.fi/).

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Node.js v20](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

### Setup

> Installation is local and doesn't require root privileges.

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Test

Run Hardhat tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

See `package.json` for more commands.

## Local deployment

WIP

## Conventions

All contributions must follow the established conventions:

1. All Solidity code must be autoformatted using Solhint. Contracts largely follow the [Official Solidity Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html) with some exceptions. When writing contracts, refer to existing contracts for conventions, naming patterns, formatting, etc.
2. All TypeScript code must be autoformatted using ESLint. When writing tests and scripts, please refer to existing codebase.
3. Commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

The repository includes a commit hook that checks your code and commit messages, resolve any issues before submitting a pull request.

## Branches

### `master`

The production branch of the protocol and the default branch of the repository. The [deployed protocol contracts](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/) must match what is stored in the `/contracts` directory. Pull requests to `master` must originate from `develop` branch and have at least one approving review before merging.

### `develop`

The development branch. All pull requests to `master` must be submitted to `develop` first for peer review. If appropriate, delete the feature branch after merging to `develop`.

## Repository structure

### Contracts

All production contracts are located in `/contracts` in the root of the project. The subdirectory names indicate the Solidity version of the contracts inside, e.g. the contracts in `/contracts/0.4.24` are all written in Solidity v0.4.24. Common interfaces and libraries shared by contracts with different versions are located in `/contracts/common` subdirectory.

### Tests

This repository features a Hardhat-Foundry dual setup:

- Hardhat gives much more flexibility when writing complex tests;
- Foundry's anvil is faster than the Hardhat Network;
- Foundry fuzzing capabilities allows for a better edge-case coverage.

#### Hardhat

Hardhat tests are all located in `/tests` in the root of the project.
Each subdirectory name corresponds to the version of the contract being tested, mirroring the `/contracts` directory
structure. Integration, regression and other non-unit tests are placed into corresponding subdirectories,
e.g. `/tests/integration/`, `/tests/regression`, etc.

#### Foundry

Foundry's Solidity tests are used only for fuzzing library contracts or functions performing complex calculations
or byte juggling. Solidity tests are located under `/tests` and in the appropriate subdirectories. Naming conventions
follow the Foundry's [documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/best-practices#general-test-guidance):

- for tests, postfix `.t.sol` is used (e.g., `MyContract.t.sol`)
- for scripts, postfix `.s.sol` is used (e.g., `MyScript.s.sol`)
- for helpers, postfix `.h.sol` is used (e.g., `MyHelper.h.sol`).

Following the convention of distinguishing Hardhat test files from Foundry-related files is essential to ensure the
proper execution of Hardhat tests.

#### Mocks

The `/tests` directory also contains contract mocks and helpers which are placed in the `.../contracts` subdirectory, e.g. `/tests/0.4.24/contracts`. Mocks and helpers **DO NOT** have to be written using the version of Solidity of the contract being tested. For example, it is okay to have a mock contract written in Solidity v0.8.9 in `/tests/0.4.24/contracts`.

### Library

TypeScript utilities and helpers are located in `/lib` in the root of the project. When adding a new file to this directory, please re-export everything from the `/lib/index.ts` file to keep import statement clean.

### Typechain types

All typechain types are placed in `/typechain-types` in the root of the project. DO NOT manually edit in this directory. These types are autogenerated on each compilation.

There have been issues with IDEs failing to properly index this directory resulting in import errors. If you are experiencing similar issues, the solutions above should resolve them:

- open the `/typechain-types/index.ts` file to force the IDE to index it;
- delete the directory and re-compile `pnpm hardhat compile --force`.

### Config files

All configuration files are located in the root of the project.
